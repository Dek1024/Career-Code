This dataset will used in hard coding a MLP (Multi Layer Perceptron) for predicting bengaluru house prizes

EDA of the dataset is also to be done

forward propagattion class
back propagation class
neural network class
    input, hidden and output layer definiton
    activation function
gradient descent class

However, for getting with the flow, a simple linear regression model will be built first
parts of a linear regression model: model
gradient descent, loss function and gradient descent
